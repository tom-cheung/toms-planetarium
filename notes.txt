emissive makes MeshPhongMaterial show up even when no light is hitting it. 

new THREE.TorusGeometry(radius, tube,radialSegments, tubularSegments, arc) 
    radius is how big the ring is (expands) 
    tube is how big the inside tube (hole) is
    radial segments is how many segments are along the edges
    tubular segments is how many angles comprise the tube, 3 would make a triangle instead of a ring 
    arc is the length of the tube, Math.Pi * 2 gives you a fully connected tube, anything less it has a gap 


new THREE.EllipseCurve maybe more accurate for an orbit 

    const curve = new THREE.EllipseCurve(
	4,  4,            // ax, aY
	10, 15,           // xRadius, yRadius
	0,  2 * Math.PI,  // aStartAngle, aEndAngle
	false,            // aClockwise
	0                 // aRotation
);

    const points = curve.getPoints( 50 ); // how many angles around the ellipse
    const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints( points );

    const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial( { color : 0xff0000 } );

    // Create the final object to add to the scene
    const ellipse = new THREE.Line( geometry, material );
